h1. simple_restful_openid plugin

Some of the other plugins in the wild were more complex than I needed, so I wrote my own.

This plugin is basically just a generator. You can delete the plugin once you run it.

h2. Usage

<pre class="console"><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/seven1m/simple_restful_openid.git
script/generate simple_restful_openid</code></pre>

To sign in, browse to /session/new

h2. Requirements

Edge Rails or Rails 2.1+
